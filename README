You can learn about setting up your own MacPorts repos at the following links.

  http://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/InstallingOlderPort
  http://journal.bitshaker.com/articles/2007/10/20/install-old-versions-of-ports-using-macports/

In short, I added this to my /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf file.

  file:///Users/kencollins/Repositories/macports [nosync]

Now run the `portindex` command while in that directory to pick up on changes to your own Portfiles.

= My ImageMagic v6.6.2 Notes

First I did a full check out of the MacPorts trunk.

  $ cd ~/Repositories
  $ svn co http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk macports_trunk
  $ cd macports_trunk

Now I found out what was the commit that had the last version v6.6.2 mentioned

  $ svn log dports/graphics/ImageMagick/Portfile
  ... examine output ...
  r69223 | ryandesign@macports.org | 2010-06-29 00:16:10 -0400 (Tue, 29 Jun 2010) | 2 lines
  ImageMagick: update to 6.6.2-9; see #25457

Now make it in out own port index.
  
  $ mkdir graphics
  $ svn co  -r 69223 'http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk/dports/graphics/ImageMagick/' graphics/ImageMagick
  $ portindex

Now install it.

  $ sudo port install ImageMagick @6.6.2-9

  $ sudo port clean ImageMagick
  $ export CC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2"
